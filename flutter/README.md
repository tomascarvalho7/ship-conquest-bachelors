# Client Application Architecture
> **Ship Conquest** client mobile application made in *Flutter* with complex visuals.

## Why use *Flutter*?
> Flutter is one of the leading frameworks for building cross-platform mobile, web, 
> and desktop applications, known for its fast development, expressive UI, and native performance.

For the development of the client application the *Flutter Framework* was chosen for it's cross-platform technology, powerful documentation 
and ease developing complex UI we need.

Before arriving on *Flutter*, a couple of mobile frameworks were tested to develop a simple isometric moving scene. The best performance results were
arrived using the *Flutter Framework* with the use of different techniques that maximized performance. This techniques are also available in the previously
tested technologies, but personally were less intuitive to reach.

## Client Application Design
> In this figure there are illustrated the main building layers of the application.

## Client Controllers Design
> In this figure is mapped the controllers organization and they're functionalities. 
> Each controller is a independent piece of business logic maintaining state.
