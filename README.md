# ship_conquest

## Concept

The project consists of a multiplayer exploration RTS game (Real Time Strategy Game), where each player controls a fleet to explore the world, fight enemies and conquer islands.
    
The project's system integrates a client application designed for mobile devices running on *Android*, and a back-end app hosted by the *Google Cloud Platform*.

Several technical concepts were worked on, namely *Procedural Generation* and pseudo-random noise algorithms such as *Perlin Noise* and *Simplex Noise* for the generation of the game's worlds, interpolation functions such as *BÃ©zier Curves*, to represent the paths taken by the ships, and search algorithms such as *A Star Algorithm* to find paths between points.

## Architecture

In the following figure, a representative scheme of the system architecture is presented, also showing the technologies used in each module.
